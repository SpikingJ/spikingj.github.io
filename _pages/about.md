## About Me
I am currently a research aasociate with King’s Communications, Learning and Information Processing ([KCLIP](https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/kclip/)) lab within the Centre for Intelligent Information Processing Systems ([CIIPS](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/centre-for-intelligent-information-processing-systems)) at the Department of Engineering, King’s College London. I am working with Prof. [Osvaldo Simeone](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m1xeKH4AAAAJ&hl=en), Prof. [Bipin Rajendran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QDEeC8EAAAAJ), and Dr. [Dengyu Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-Ji_VmkAAAAJ), focusing on neuromorphic wireless communications.

Prior to that, I obtained my PhD degree at King's College London, supervised by Prof. Osvaldo Simeone. 

My research interests focus on neuromorphic computing and its applications in wireless communications. If it aligns with your interests, please feel free to reach out.
